Arlo helps you change cultures in large organizations. He transitions hundreds or thousands of people at a time to full technical and cultural prowess in a way that sticks.

More importantly, Arlo gives your company the ability to change its own culture. He seeks to be the last consultant you will ever need to hire. After 6 months, you should be able to adapt your culture, practices, and company structures to meet novel challenges, each in a matter of days.

Arlo tries stuff in the real world. Some of it works. Some doesn't. Then he talks about what he tried. He knows the theory, but only cares about the practical outcomes.

He's also got this thing with names. His innovations include Naked Planning, Promiscuous Pairing, and Drunken Estimation. Oh, and he's Bloody Stupid from time to time.

For a good time, chat him up in a hall, a bar, or online.
